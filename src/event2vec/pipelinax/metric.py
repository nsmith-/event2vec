# TODO: Create the metric protocol and an abstract implementation (similar to
# loss). Metrics can return numeric scalars, histograms objects, images, etc.
# The abstract implementation should combine jittable and non-jittable stages
# of the computation. Likewise for mini-batched and final accumulation stages.
